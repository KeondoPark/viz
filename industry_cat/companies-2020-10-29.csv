The world’s leading ARDs have chosen to partner with CORE-POWER because we bring access to pent-up demand from a market with real customers. The marine-Molten Salt Reactor (m-MSR) is set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040. The m-MSR is the technology that forms the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 197 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. The m-MSR is like an atomic battery pack. The m-MSR is small, with no moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. The m-MSR is inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. In an m-MSR the fuel is the coolant, and the coolant is the fuel, so coolant cannot be lost. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion. The m-MSR has an economic potential which is greater than that of oil and gas. It can provide all the sustainable, clean energy we need to move us deep into the future without polluting the environment.",Early Stage Venture,3,,,,2020-08-01,Series B,,,,,,,Private,,,774,729,,,,,4300000,USD,4300000,4300000,USD,4300000,"Energy, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Sustainability, Transportation",1-10,1

Trust is the common thread that connects today’s elastic enterprise--trust that your identity solution will be there when you need it most and trust that your end-users know their information is safe.  The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform is the identity foundation to build secure, scalable and smart trusted experiences that connect people with technology. With OneLogin, seamlessly manage digital identities for your workforce and customers, so you can focus on what matters most--growing your business.  With OneLogin’s complete solution, you can easily connect all of your applications, leverage our proprietary machine learning to identify and analyze potential threats and act quickly using contextual authentication requirements. Secure: Security is the cornerstone of trust. It’s the confidence that your identity solution is reliable and always-on, so you can focus on what matters--growing the business. The OneLogin platform protects your organization against threats by securing and centralizing your applications, devices, and end-users all in one, easy-to-access place. Additionally, through our advanced machine learning capabilities, OneLogin can deliver real-time threat intelligence to help automate the process of keeping your business secure.  Scalable: The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform was built for performance and reliability at scale. With a wide breadth of extensible functionality, we can expand and retract according to the changing needs of your business. Through our enterprise-grade change management solutions, like our Enterprise Sandbox and API Access, you can quickly test large-scale changes before going live in your production instance. Our high availability Login Clusters elastically load-balance providing reliable, continuous service when you need it the most. That means if your database is impacted for any reason, your OneLogin environment won’t be impacted.   Smart: The risk of cyberattacks continue to increase as perpetrators look for smarter and less-detectable ways to circumvent security solutions. And for today’s businesses, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to implement solutions that evolve as the methods of attackers evolve. Although Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has become the defacto tool to protect end-user credentials and your business’ sensitive data, static authentication simply isn’t enough. Additionally, as identity management solutions seek to find more ways to secure the enterprise, user experience is often sacrificed, causing end-users to become increasingly agitated, often seeking out ways to evade having to authenticate several times.  Simple: Ease-of-use and speed-of-adoption are imperative to ensuring your identity and access management strategy is effectively rolled out across your organization. And in order to achieve that the solution you choose must be simple. And that means simple for you and simple for your users.  OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Citizen, Evernote, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Stitch Fix, and Uber.

We bring the benefits of the cloud to you: simplified administration reduced IT costs, improved security, and enhanced user experience. OneLogin Access eliminates aging Access Management tools that are complex, expensive, and disconnected from modern SaaS environments. Through the OneLogin portal, users enjoy a simple, consistent experience with single-click access to SaaS and on-premise applications from any device. OneLogin SmartFactor AuthenticationTM: As part of our Trusted Experience Platform™, SmartFactor Authentication leverages our Vigilance AI™ risk score to dynamically adjust authentication requirements in real-time based on the level of risk for each login, balancing security with usability. OneLogin’s SmartFactor Authentication uses machine learning to analyze a broad range of inputs, such as location, device, and user behavior, to calculate a risk score and determine the most appropriate security action to take for each login attempt. Depending on the detected level of risk, SmartFactor Authentication adjusts the number of authentication factors needed to log in. OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Cloud RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Merakiwireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short. ACQUISITIONS:  In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. RECOGNITION: In November 2019, OneLogin was named a 2019 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Access Management Software.
